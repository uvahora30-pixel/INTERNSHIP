Setup notes — what you must change / consider

EmailJS

Create an account at https://www.emailjs.com/
 and add an email service.

Create an email template with fields from_name, from_email, phone, subject, message, hotel.

Replace the placeholders in two places:

In contact.html: emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID"); → replace YOUR_USER_ID with your EmailJS user/public key.

In scripts.js: EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID and EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID → replace with your service & template IDs.

Font Awesome

I included CDN link — if you prefer, swap to a local version.

Google Map

The included iframe is a public embed (works without API key). If you want a custom map with advanced styling or Places, use Google Maps Platform and replace iframe with the Maps JS API.

WhatsApp number

The href on the WhatsApp button uses wa.me/919876543210 — change the phone to your hotel's WhatsApp number (in international format, no + or leading zeros).

Dark mode & accessibility

Dark mode preference is saved in localStorage (key rg_darkmode). Keyboard accessible modal; focus outlines kept.

Deployment

Place all three files in the same folder and open contact.html. Or integrate into your site layout.
